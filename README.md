# Facial_keypoints_recognition
Facial Keypoint Detection is a computer vision technique used to identify and locate specific key landmarks on the face, such as the eyes, nose, mouth, and jawline. These keypoints are crucial for tasks like facial recognition, emotion detection, face alignment, and augmented reality applications. Using deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), facial keypoint detection can accurately predict the positions of these landmarks in images, enabling advanced analysis and interaction with facial data in real-time.
